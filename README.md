# Price_prediction_with_blending_model

House Prices dataset has the advantage to use advanced regression techniques and using experimental feature engineering techniques with 79 explanatory variables.

This dataset contains every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa and this notebook aims to use feature engineering techniques with 79 explanatory variables and make predictions with using advanced regression techniques.

There are some techniques included in this notebook like box-cox transformation, creating a stack model and blending for final results, scaler methods to achieve low error numbers, etc. The goal of this notebook is to use advanced regression methods with its parameters and achieve the lowest error by eliminating correct features, encoding with the right methods, and using right hyperparameters for each algorithm.

This notebook has 5 topics:

* Exploratory Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Hyperparameter Tunning
* Model Building
* Model Results

## Dependencies

* Pandas
* NumPy
* SciKit-Learn
* Seaborn
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* XGBoost
* LGBM
* mlxtend
